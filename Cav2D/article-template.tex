\noindent
Bonaventura Cavalieri was a mathematician who lived in the 17th century. He made numerous contributions to the fields of optics, astronomy and geometry. 
Cavalieri was a student of Galileo. He served as a professor of mathematics at the university of Bologna from 1629 until his death in 1647. 
Galileo held Cavalieri in high esteem as is evedent from the following extract of a reference letter Galileo wrote in which he recommended Cavalieri for the chair of mathematics at Bologna: ``\emph{few, perhaps none, from 
Archimedes onwards, have investigated so deeply and have entered so far into the science of geometry}''. In 1935, a moon crater, Cavalerius, was officially named after him to commemorate his achievements and to honor his memory (see Fig ) \cite{?}. Cavalieri's most notable achievement was the publication of his 
treatise, \emph{Geometria indivisibilibus}, in which he describes the precalculus method of indivisibles. The method of indivisibles can be attributed to the ancient Greeks,
in this case Democritus and Archimedes. The method is used to compute the area and the volume of complex planar figures and solids, respectively.
It works by finding a planar figure or a solid, whose area or volume can easily be computed, which is Cavalieri congruent to a planar figure or solid whose 
area or volume is unknown. Two planar figures or solids are Cavalieri congruent if they can be decomposed into the same set of parallel ``indivisibles''. An indivisible of 
a planar figure is any cord of the planar figure. An indivisible of a solid is any planar section of a solid. Two indivisibles are equal if they are of the same length or area.
It is Cavalieri's principle that assures us that two planar figures or solids that are composed of the same set of indivisibles have equal area or volume. Cavalieri's principle 
in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is stated below without proof:

\begin{theorem}[Cavalieri's principle in $\mathbb{R}^3$]
If two solids are included between a pair of parallel planes, and if the areas of
the two sections cut by them on any plane parallel to the including planes are always
equal, then the volumes of the two solids are equal.
\end{theorem}



\noindent
Fig~\ref{??} depicts a classic rectangular prism or column as well as a \emph{non-linear rectangular prism or column}. The volumes of the two solids in Fig~\ref{??} are equal due 
to Cavalieri's principle. Note that in this article we use the non-standerdized term non-linear rectangular prism or column to refer to a solid that has a rectangular 
base and lateral edges that are non-linear and translations of one another.

\section{Cavalieri Integral}
In this section we define the Cavalieri integral \cite{ackermann12}. 


Let the region $R$ be bounded by the $x$-axis and the lines $f(x)=x$, $a(y)=1-y$ and $b(y)=4-y$. This region is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:caval2}.\\
%\begin{figure}[htb]

\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{fig13.eps}
\caption{Region bounded by the $x$-axis and the lines $f(x)=x$, $a(y)=1-y$, and $b(y)=4-y$. The figure also depicts the partition points $x_i^1$ and $x_i^2$ as used in the Cavalieri sum (see Eq.~\eqref{eq:cav_sum}). Reproduced from Quaestiones Mathematicae (2012) 35: 265-296 with permission \copyright~ NISC (Pty) Ltd.}
\label{fig:caval2}
\end{figure}

\noindent
We can compute the area of $R$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
\int_0^2x\, dx+\int_2^44-x\, dx- \int_0^{\frac{1}{2}}x\, dx-\int_{\frac{1}{2}}^11-x\, dx = 3.75. 
\end{equation}

\noindent
Alternatively, the area of $R$ can also be determined via the Cavalieri integral:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:caval1}
\int_{a(y)}^{b(y)}f(x)\, dx = \lim_{n\to \infty}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f(x_i^2)\Delta x_i^1,
\end{equation}
with $\Delta x_i^1 = x_{i+1}^1 - x_i^1$. Furthermore, the partition points $(x_i^1)_{i=0}^{n}$ and $(x_i^2)_{i=0}^{n}$ are depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:caval2}. Let us review why this is in fact the case:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\Delta x_i^1 = x_{i+1}^1 - x_i^1$ represents the width of a non-rectangular integration strip.
 \item $f(x_i^2)$ represents the height of a non-rectangular integration strip.
 \item $f(x_i^2)\Delta x_i^1$ represents the height of a non-rectangular integration strip (due to Cavalieri's principle).
 \item The Cavalieri sum $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f(x_i^2)\Delta x_i^1$, therefore, approximates the area of $R$.
 \item In the limit the Cavalieri sum, therefore, approaches the area of $R$.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
The Cavalieri integral is, however, hard to evaluate directly. Fortunately, it is easy to convert a Cavalieri integral into an equivalent Riemann integral:
\begin{equation}
\int_{a(y)}^{b(y)}f(x)\, dx = \int_{a}^{b} f\circ h(x)~dx, 
\end{equation}
with $a(0) = a$, $b(0)=b$ and $h = g^{-1}$. Furthermore, $g(x) = x - a\circ f(x) + a$.

\noindent
The area of $R$ can, therefore, also be computed as follows:
\begin{equation}
\int_{a(y)}^{b(y)}f(x)\, dx = \int_a^b f \circ h (x)\, dx = \dfrac{1}{2}\int_1^4x\, dx = 3.75.  
\end{equation}

As will become apparent later on in the article extending the definition of the Cavalieri integral as it appears in ?? into $\mathbb{R}^3$ is problematic. However,
if the definition in ?? is first re-expressed in vector calculus notation then it becomes trivial to extend it into $\mathbb{R}^3$.

Let $\mathbf{c}(t) = \left <c_x(t),c_y(t) \right>$ be the vector equation of $a(y)-a$. Note that, for every coordinate $(x_i^1,x_i^2) \in [a,b]  [a',b']$ there exists a unique $t\in\mathbb{R}$ such that
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pat_rel}
\left <x_i^2,f(x_i^2) \right > = \left <x_i^1,0 \right> + \left<c_x(t),c_y(t) \right > 
\end{equation}
Equation~\eqref{eq:pat_rel} can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:t_func}
c_y(t) = f(x_i^1 + c_x(t)).
\end{equation}
Equation~\eqref{eq:t_func} implies that $t$ can be expressed in terms of $x_i^1$. We can, therefore, calculate $h(x_i^1)$ using $t(x_i^1)$ via:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:h_func}
x_i^2 = h(x_i^1) = x_i^1 + c_x\circ t(x_i^1).
\end{equation}
Equation~\eqref{eq:h_func} is a trivial consequence of the definition of $h$ and Equation~\eqref{eq:pat_rel}.




and as such $t(x_i^1)$ can be used to determine $h(x_i^1)$.
i.e. $t$ is a function 





It is therefore possible to define $t$ in terms of $x_i^1$.  


\noindent
Expressing \eqref{eq:caval1} in vector calculus notation

\begin{equation}
\int_{a(y)}^{b(y)}f(x)\, dx =\cint_a^b f(x)~dx, 
\end{equation}
with $\mathbf{c}(t) = <c_x(t),c_y(t)>$ denoting a vector equation that passes through the origin and is a translation of $a(y)$. We can express $a(y)$ as $\mathbf{c}(t) + <a,0>$.
Note that partition $x_i^1$ and $x_i^2$ are related to each other via: 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pat_rel}
<x_i^2,f(x_i^2)> = <x_i^1,0> + <c_x(t),c_y(t)> 
\end{equation}

It follows from Eq.~\eqref{eq:pat_rel} that 
\begin{equation}
c_y(t) = f(x_i^1 + c_x(t)). 
\end{equation}
We can therefore express $t$ as a function of $x_i^1$. We can now compute $h(x_i^1) = x_i^1 + t(x_i^1)$.








 






%One first divides a complex planar figure whose area is unknown into indivisible parallel chords. These cords are then translated 
%in such a way that the original planar figure is transformed into a planar figure whose area is easily computable. The volume of a complex solid can be computed 
%in a similar manner. 
%In this method areas of complex planar figures are computed by dividing such figures into indivisible parallel chords. One then 
%finds another planar figure whose area is known that consists of the exact same set of chords. The area of the complex planar figure is then 
 


\begin{abstract}
We presented a novel geometric interpretation of the Riemann-Liouville fractional integral. We found that a Riemann-Liouville integral can 
be thought of as the area obtained by summing together the area of an infinite number of non-rectangular infinitesimals whose shape is determined by the 
order of integration $\alpha$ and the integration limit $t$. We also showed that this geometric interpretation offers many pedagogical benefits as it is very similar
in nature to the geometric interpretation of the Riemann integral.
