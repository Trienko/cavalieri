\noindent
Bonaventura Cavalieri was a mathematician who lived in the 17th century. He made numerous contributions to the fields of optics, astronomy and geometry. 
Cavalieri was a student of Galileo. He served as a professor of mathematics at the university of Bologna from 1629 until his death in 1647. 
Galileo held Cavalieri in high esteem as is evedent from the following extract of a reference letter Galileo wrote in which he recommended Cavalieri for the chair of mathematics at Bologna: ``\emph{few, perhaps none, from 
Archimedes onwards, have investigated so deeply and have entered so far into the science of geometry}''. In 1935, a moon crater, Cavalerius, was officially named after him to commemorate his achievements and to honor his memory (see Fig ) \cite{?}. Cavalieri's most notable achievement was the publication of his 
treatise, \emph{Geometria indivisibilibus}, in which he describes the precalculus method of indivisibles. The method of indivisibles can be attributed to the ancient Greeks,
in this case Democritus and Archimedes. The method is used to compute the area and the volume of complex planar figures and solids, respectively.
It works by finding a planar figure or a solid, whose area or volume can easily be computed, which is Cavalieri congruent to a planar figure or solid whose 
area or volume is unknown. Two planar figures or solids are Cavalieri congruent if they can be decomposed into the same set of parallel ``indivisibles''. An indivisible of 
a planar figure is any cord of the planar figure. An indivisible of a solid is any planar section of a solid. Two indivisibles are equal if they are of the same length or area.
It is Cavalieri's principle that assures us that two planar figures or solids that are composed of the same set of indivisibles have equal area or volume. Cavalieri's principle 
in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is stated below without proof:

\begin{theorem}[Cavalieri's principle in $\mathbb{R}^3$]
If two solids are included between a pair of parallel planes, and if the areas of
the two sections cut by them on any plane parallel to the including planes are always
equal, then the volumes of the two solids are equal.
\end{theorem}



\noindent
Fig~\ref{??} depicts a classic rectangular prism or column as well as a \emph{non-linear rectangular prism or column}. The volumes of the two solids in Fig~\ref{??} are equal due 
to Cavalieri's principle. Note that in this article we use the non-standerdized term non-linear rectangular prism or column to refer to a solid that has a rectangular 
base and lateral edges that are non-linear and translations of one another.

\section{Cavalieri Integral}
In this section we define the Cavalieri integral \cite{ackermann12}. Let the region $R$ be bounded by the $x$-axis and the lines $f(x)=x$, $a(y)=1-y$ and $b(y)=4-y$. This region is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:caval2}.\\

The figure also depicts the partition points $x_i^2$ as used in the Cavalieri sum (see Eq.~\eqref{eq:cav_sum}).

\noindent
The area of $R$ can be determined as follows if we employ the classical notion of integration:
\begin{equation}
\int_0^2x\, dx+\int_2^44-x\, dx- \int_0^{\frac{1}{2}}x\, dx-\int_{\frac{1}{2}}^11-x\, dx = 3.75. 
\end{equation}

\noindent
There, however, exists a more straightforward way do determine the area of $R$, i.e. we can sum together the area of non-rectangular integration strips inscribing $R$ instead of
having to sum together the area of multiple rectangular integration strips. Moreover, the shape of the non-rectangular integration strips we should use is determined by the function $a(y)$. We can express this notion more formally as 
follows, let $(x_i^1)_{i=0}^{n}$ denote a partition on the $x$-axis, such that $a = x_0^1 < x_1^1 < \cdots < x_n^1 = b$, and $\Delta x_i^1 = x_{i+1}^1 - x_i^1$.
We are now able to construct the following sum (the lower Cavalieri sum):
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cav_sum}
\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f(x_i^2)\Delta x_i^1.
\end{equation}
The partition points $(x_i^2)_{i=0}^{n}$ are depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:caval2}. Note that Eq.~\eqref{eq:cav_sum} approximates the area of $R$. In the limit Eq.~\eqref{eq:cav_sum} approaches 
the Cavalieri integral:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:caval1}
\int_{a(y)}^{b(y)}f(x)\, dx = \lim_{n\to \infty}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f(x_i^2)\Delta x_i^1.
\end{equation}
It is, however, quite hard to evaluate the above integral directly. Fortunately, it is easy to convert a Cavalieri integral into an equivalent Riemann or Riemann-Stieltjes 
integral by using the transformation functions $h$ and $g$. Expressed mathematically:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:main_cav}
\int_{a(y)}^{b(y)}f(x)\,dx =\int_a^b f \circ h (x)\, dx = \int_{a'}^{b'} f(x) dg(x).
\end{equation}
We can calculate $g$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
g(x) = x - a\circ f(x) + a.
\end{equation}
Moreover, $h=g^{-1}$. We can now evaluate the Cavalieri integral by using its equivalent Riemann or Rieman-Stieltjes integral.
If we use its Riemann equivalent we obtain:
\begin{equation}
\int_{a(y)}^{b(y)}f(x)\, dx = \int_a^b f \circ h (x)\, dx = \dfrac{1}{2}\int_1^4x\, dx = 3.75.  
\end{equation}
If we use its Riemann-Stieltjes equivalent we obtain:
\begin{equation}
\int_{a(y)}^{b(y)}f(x)\, dx = \int_{a'}^{b'} f \, dg(x) = \int_{\frac{1}{2}}^2x\, d2x = 3.75.  
\end{equation}

\noindent
Conversely, if $g$ is known (and not $a(y)$) and $g(a') = a$ then we can calculate $a(y)$ using the following \cite{grobler19}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:a_y}
a(y) = f^{-1}(y) - g\circ f^{-1}(y) + g(a'). 
\end{equation}
Eq.~\eqref{eq:a_y} allows us to transform a Riemann-Stieltjes integral into an equivalent Cavalieri integral. 
Furthermore, this transformation enables us to assign a geometric interpretation to a Riemann-Stieltjes integral. The interpretation being:
it represents the area obtained by summing together the area of an infinite number of non-rectangular infinitesimals; all of them being translations of $a(y)$. Note,
$b(y) = a(y) + (b-a)$.






%One first divides a complex planar figure whose area is unknown into indivisible parallel chords. These cords are then translated 
%in such a way that the original planar figure is transformed into a planar figure whose area is easily computable. The volume of a complex solid can be computed 
%in a similar manner. 
%In this method areas of complex planar figures are computed by dividing such figures into indivisible parallel chords. One then 
%finds another planar figure whose area is known that consists of the exact same set of chords. The area of the complex planar figure is then 
 


\begin{abstract}
We presented a novel geometric interpretation of the Riemann-Liouville fractional integral. We found that a Riemann-Liouville integral can 
be thought of as the area obtained by summing together the area of an infinite number of non-rectangular infinitesimals whose shape is determined by the 
order of integration $\alpha$ and the integration limit $t$. We also showed that this geometric interpretation offers many pedagogical benefits as it is very similar
in nature to the geometric interpretation of the Riemann integral.
